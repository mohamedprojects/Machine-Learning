# Machine Learning 
Machine learning : is about learning from historical data, understanding and reasoning, doing what humans can do, and training machines to act much faster, better, and easier. 
Machine learning has two subcategories: supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
## Supervised learning
Supervised learning: is teaching or training a machine with well-labeled data. Then, using a new set of examples, a supervised learning algorithm tried to predict the correct result from the training data. Supervised learning can be divided into two categories of algorithms.
1- ***Classification***: Output variables are categories such as "disease" and "no disease".

2- ***Regression***: Output variables are real values, such as "weights". 
## Unsupervised learning
Unsupervised learning: You have unlabeled data, and you are trying to categorize the data and find patterns based on many criteria. We have a lot of examples of unsupervised learning such as: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering...
